<h2>Game engine for Platformer</h2>

\> [Home](../../../README.md)

### Presentation :


Welcome to the readme file of our game engine built in java with LibGDX and Tiled.</br>
This engine was thinking for platformer games, you can do whatever you want, especially :  
- Create and manage your **assets**,
- Create your own **entity factories**,
- Create your own **levels** and manage the **order** of its,
- Manage the pre-built **inputs**,

</br>
We let you check out every part of the documentation to understand how to use correctly the game engine.  

If you want, you can see some images at *[Images of the game engine](../examples/images.md)*.  
This is not an effective game, but it shows us what we can do with the engine.
