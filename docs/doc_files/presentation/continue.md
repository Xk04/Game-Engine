### Presentation : *How to use the project ?*

#### How to compile the project ?

You can use the `./gradlew build` command, but I advise you to just run the project if you just want to see the project in real time.


#### How to run the project ?

LibGDX is delivered with a tool named gradle. It allows us to create a windows and display a game.
With the command `./gradlew lwjgl3:run` you can run the project.

You can use another method with the gradle extension of your favorite IDE with this [tutorial](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/import-and-running).

#### How to test the project ?

Use the command `./gradlew test` to generate tests. For more informations go to [*Tests Documentation*](../test/test.md) page.
