### Presentation : *Technologies used*

To build this project, we used the tools required for the course along with the testing libraries studied in class.

* **LibGDX**: used for the development of the game engine.
* **Tiled**: used for the creation and configuration of the maps. It allows us to design levels on a 32x32 grid and define collision layers and object positions
* **JUnit & Hamcrest**: used for validation through unit testing
* **GitHub**: used for version control. It allowed us to collaborate and share code
